# Token plugin for spigot

Hi, I wanted to share this plugin to the public because I really wanted to make something that everyone can use. <br>
This plugin uses MySQL only, but in the future I am definetly going to add an offline saving and better encryption. <br>

Well Its simple, add the plugin to your plugins folder restart the server and then in the config.yml<br>
change it to your preferences.

- %error%
</p>
<h4>Scoreboard:</h4>

<h3>UPDATES:</h3>

<h3>Q&A</h3>
Why did I make this project?<br>
Well, one day I was trying to find free economy plugin (I know there is Essentials but this is the style i wanted to find) <br>but I didn't find anything updated so <br>this is my own
implementation of Token Plugin

<h3>DISCLAIMER:</h3>
This is a "early access" of this plugin
